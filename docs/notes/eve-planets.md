# EVE facts: planetary industry

What ESI says and doesn't about planets, colonies and their goods. Split from eve-facts.md on 1 October 2026 (which market
groups hold planetary goods stays there: the income rules read it).

Don't re-derive or contradict these without new evidence.

- **Planet types come from `/universe/planets/{id}` → `type_id` → `Planet (Barren)`.** Richness — the
  thing that decides what a PI planet actually yields — exists only in the client, not in ESI.
- **Lower security means richer PI planets, and that holds *inside* high-sec**: a 0.5 extracts more
  than a 1.0. A PI system list must therefore not default to sorting by security descending, which is
  the instinct everywhere else here and is exactly backwards. The size of the difference is not in
  ESI, so don't put a number on it.
- **150 units of raw make one refined unit.** A Basic Industry Facility takes 3,000 per 30-minute
  cycle and returns 20, so one gets through 6,000 an hour for 40 out. This was once written as 14,
  which flattered refining roughly tenfold and told people to build factories for a 1.08× gain while
  showing them 11.6×. ESI does not serve schematic inputs — only names and cycle times — but the
  30-minute cycle **is** confirmed there: exactly 15 schematics carry an 1,800-second cycle and they
  are exactly the 15 refined products. An Advanced facility is 40 each of **two different** refined
  goods for 5 processed, hourly: 16 in per 1 out.
- **Which refined pair makes which processed good is not in ESI and is not guessed at.** The factory
  lists them in the client. Naming recipes from memory is how the 14 got in.
- **A PI extraction programme has an end date and then simply stops** (`expiry_time` on the extractor
  pin). The colony looks normal, factories drain what is left, and it earns nothing until the heads
  are reset — the commonest way PI money is lost, and a field nothing was reading.
- **Colony pins are classified by shape, not by type ID**: `extractor_details` makes it an extractor,
  `factory_details` a factory, anything else that holds things is storage. No list to go stale.
- **`qty_per_cycle` is not a flat rate.** Real extraction decays across a programme, so the per-hour
  figure derived from it is the top of the range. Say so rather than presenting it as steady.
